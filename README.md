# Compiler-Design-Code-optimization


## ABSTRACT:-

This project aims to develop a code optimizer using compiler design concepts to improve the performance and efficiency of code. The optimizer analyses input code and applies various optimization techniques to generate an optimized output code that executes faster, consumes less memory, and/or reduces the number of instructions required. The project involves studying principles and techniques of compiler design, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, optimization, and code generation. The project also involves implementing algorithms and data structures for performing code transformations and applying optimization techniques such as constant folding, loop unrolling, register allocation, and instruction scheduling.


## Requirements:-

The script may require the installation of additional libraries or dependencies, such as the LLVM framework, to enable the implementation of optimization techniques.

The script may require the user to have administrator or root access to install dependencies, modify system settings, or perform other privileged actions.
